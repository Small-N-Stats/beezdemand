##' Changes 0 values or applies a parallel shift.
##'
##' Takes a matrix of consumption values and replaces specified number of 0s with replacement value. Optionally, can apply a parallel shift to all consumption values and prices.
##' @title Change 0s
##' @param mat A matrix of consumption values.
##' @param repl The number of 0s to be replaced by replnum. Default is NULL (i.e., all 0s).
##' @param replnum Replacement number. Default value is 0.01.
##' @param parshift Whether to apply a parallel shift of replnum to all consumption and prices.
##' @param prices If parshift == TRUE, value is required.
##' @return Matrix of transformed data. If parshift == TRUE, list of 2. First element is the transformed matrix. Second element is transformed price vector.

##' Splits a matrix of purchase task data into individual dataframes consisting of price, consumption, and expenditure.
##'
##' This function takes a matrix and splits it into a list of dataframes. Each dataframe consists of prices (x), consumption values (y), and expenditure values (expend). If a participant has no consumption, the dataframe will instead be a character vector indicating "No consumption." If a participant has fewer than 3 datapoints, the dataframe will instead be a character vector indicating "Fewer than 3 datapoints." Note that these conditions are more likely to be met when 0s are deleted.
##' @title Split Matrix
##' @param mat A matrix in wide form where each column is a participant's responses. If a dataframe is provided, it will attempt to coerce it into a matrix.
##' @param x A vector of prices used in the purchase task. The number of elements must be equal to the number of rows in the matrix.
##' @param incl0 If FALSE, ALL 0 values and their associated prices will be removed, even those that precede reverals from 0.
##' @param replfree Optionally replaces price=0 with specified number.
##' @return A list of dataframes and/or character vectors whose length is equal to the number of columns (i.e., participants) in the original matrix. Prints the number of cases that contain no consumption and fewer than 3 datapoints.
