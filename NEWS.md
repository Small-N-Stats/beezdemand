# beezdemand 0.0.84

## New updates

* New `ChangeData()` will soon serve as the replacement to
  `ReplaceZeros()` and other arguments specified in `FitCurves()`.

* For the time being, `FitCurves()` will actually output a list
  object. This may cause failures with old scripts. Try modifying
  scripts to take the first element out of the list. This will soon be
  taken care of.

## Tidying

* Email contact has been changed and some minor updates to .rd files.

# beezdemand 0.0.6

## New features

* New `FitMeanCurves()` will fit curve to averaged or pooled
  data. Can also make plots.

* `FitCurves()` can now make plots.

* `GetDescriptives()` can make box and whisker plots.

## Cleanup

* Old code from previous workflow is removed. Now all functions use
  longform data.
